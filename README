Welcome to this Balloon simulator!

In order to use the simulation, you will need 2 things:
1) an outline of the seam of the balloon (.svg)
2) a picture to be textured onto the balloon (.jpg or .png)
These will need to have the same coordinates (no resizing). I would recommend saving just one layer of an Illustrator or Inkscape for the outline, and exporting the whole thing for the texture.

Once input, you can subdivide, resize, inflate, and texture the balloon. I recommend not making it too large while using a high amount of subdivisions - this is an easy way to make it crash. When saved, it is exported as .stl. The surface area and volume values are approximate.
